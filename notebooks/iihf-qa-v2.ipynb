      "        A Player shall be permitted to catch the puck out of the air but must immediately place it or knock it down to the ice.\n",
      "A Player shall be assessed a Minor Penalty for \"closing their hand on the puck\": (I) If they catch it and skates with it, either to avoid a check or to gain a \"territorial advantage\" over their opponent. (II) If they place their hand over the puck while it is on the ice in order to conceal it from or prevent an opponent from playing the puck. When this is done in their Team's Goal Crease area, a \"Penalty Shot\" shall be assessed Rule 67.4 – Penalty Shot, or Rule 67.5 – Goal Awarded. (III) If they pick the puck up off the ice with their hand while play is in progress\n",
      "A Minor Penalty shall be assessed for \"Delay of Game\" – Face-off Violation to a Player taking the \"face-off\" who:  (I) Attempts to win the \"face-off\" by batting the puck with their hand. Note: The two (2) Players involved in the actual \"face-off\" (the centers) are not permitted to play the puck with their hand without incurring a penalty under this rule until such time as a third Player (from either Team) has at least touched the puck. Once the \"face-off\" is deemed complete (and a winner of the \"face-off\" is clear) hand passes shall be enforced ➔ Rule 79 – Hand Pass.\n",

      "A \"Delay of Game\" penalty shall be assessed to a Goalkeeper who: (I) Holds the puck with their hands for longer than three (3) seconds unless they are actually being \"checked / pressured\" by an opponent; (II) Deliberately holds the puck in any manner which, in the opinion of the Referee, causes an unnecessary stoppage of play; (III) Throws the puck forward towards the opponent's net; Note: In the case where the puck thrown forward by the Goalkeeper being taken by an opponent, the Referee shall allow the resulting play to be completed, and if goal is scored by the non-offending Team, it shall be allowed and no penalty given; but if a goal is not scored, play shall be stopped and a Minor Penalty shall be imposed against the Goalkeeper;. (IV) Drops the puck into their pads or onto the goal net; (V) Deliberately piles up snow or obstacles at or near their net that, in the opinion of the Referee, would tend to prevent the scoring of a goal.\n",

In other words, goals scored while attacking Players are standing in the Goal Crease may, in appropriate circumstances be allowed. \n",
      "Goals should be disallowed only if: (I) an attacking Player, either by their positioning or by a \"relevant contact\", impairs the Goalkeeper's ability to move freely within their Goal Crease or defend their goal; or (II) an attacking Player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a Goalkeeper, inside or outside of their Goal Crease.\n",

For purposes of this rule, \"contact / relevant contact\" whether \"incidental or otherwise\", shall mean any contact that is made between or among a Goalkeeper and attacking Player(s), whether by means of a stick or any part of the body. The overriding rationale of this rule is that a Goalkeeper should have the ability to move freely within their Goal Crease without being hindered by the actions of an attacking Player. If an attacking Player enters the Goal Crease and, by their actions, impairs the Goalkeeper's ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.

If a defending Player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by an attacking Player so as to cause the defending Player to come into contact with their own Goalkeeper, such contact shall be deemed contact initiated by the attacking Player for purposes of this rule, and if necessary, a penalty assessed to the attacking Player and if a goal is scored it would be disallowed.\n",
