      question: >
        During the first period of overtime in the playoffs, Team A is serving a minor penalty. 
        The clock stops with 9:58 remaining in the period. Suddenly the Zamboni gate opens, and the 
        ice crew comes onto the ice to shovel the excess snow. Is this permitted?
      answer: >
        The Referee shall bring this to the attention of the offending 
        team and to the official scorekeeper, so the proper corrections can be made. 
        No penalty is assessed.

      title: BOARDS AND PROTECTIVE GLASS
      rule: >
        The Rink shall be surrounded by a wall known as the "Boards". The ideal height of the boards above the ice surface shall be 1.07 m
        (42 in). Except for the official markings provided for in these rules, the entire playing surface and the Boards shall be white in color
        except the "Kick Plate" at the bottom of the Boards, which shall be light yellow in color. Any variations from any of the foregoing
        dimensions shall require official authorization by the IIHF.
        The Boards shall be constructed in such a manner that the surface facing the ice shall be smooth and free of any obstruction or
        any object that could cause injury to Players. Affixed to the Boards and extending vertically shall be an approved "Protective Glass" 
        construction. The height above the Boards behind the Goals must be 2.4 m (8 ft) and must extend at least 4.0 m (13 ft) from the "Goal
        Line" towards the Blue Line. The height above the Boards along the sides must be 1.8 m (6 ft), except in front of the Players' Benches.
        Protective Glass shall be required in front of the Penalty Boxes.

    title: SIGNAL AND TIMING DEVICES
    situations:
    - number: 4.1.0
      question: The game clock shows that time has expired, but the horn has not sounded to signal the end of the period. Is the period over?
      answer: >
        Yes. As soon as one of the officials notices that time has expired, they should blow the whistle 
        to stop play. If a goal is scored after time has run out (but before an official notices), the 
        Referee shall consult with the Video Review Operations, and the goal may be disallowed.
      rule references:
      - unknown
    - number: 4.2.0
      question: One of the officials notices that play has started but that the clock is not running. What is the procedure?
      answer: >
        Play may continue until the officials have the opportunity and/or need to stop the play 
        (if stopped, it should be done when the puck is in the neutral zone, and when no immediate scoring opportunity 
        is imminent – i.e., breakaway, empty net, etc.). 
        Play may be allowed to continue to a normal stoppage in play. 
        The Referee should then confer with the Game Timekeeper and/or the Video Review Operations to 
        reset the clock to the proper time.
      rule references:

      title: SIGNAL DEVICES
      rule: >
        Each Rink must be provided with a suitable sound device that will sound automatically at the conclusion of
        each period of play. Should the sound device fail to sound automatically when time expires, 
        the determining factor as to whether the period has ended shall be the Game Clock.
    - number: 4.2
      title: TIMING DEVICES
      rule: >
        Each Rink shall be provided with some form of electronic Scoreclock for the purpose of
        keeping the spectators, Players, Team Personnel and Game Officials accurately informed as to all time elements at all stages of the game including the time remaining to
        be played in any period and the time remaining to be served by penalized 
        Players on each Team. The Scoreclock is activated by facing-off of the puck by an 
        On-ice Official and shall be stopped by the whistle of an Off-ice Official.
        Time recording for both game time and penalty time shall show time remaining to be 
        played or served. The Game Time Clock shall measure the time remaining in tenths (1/10) 
        of a second during the last minute of each period.

    title: TEAM
    situations:
    - number: 5.1.0
      question: >
        Prior to the start of the game, after receiving the line-up from the Official Scorer, 
        the Referees notice that the name one of the players on the visiting team's 
        line-up has been written down twice with two different numbers for a total of 
        20 skaters and two goalkeepers. What procedure would the officials follow to 
        rectify this situation?
      answer: >
        The Referee shall bring this to the attention of the offending team and to the 
        official scorekeeper, so the proper corrections can be made. 
        No penalty is assessed.
      rule references:
      - 5.1
    - number: 5.2.0
      question: >
        At the 14:00 minute mark of the first period, Team A scores a goal. 
        Just before the Referee drops the puck at center ice, the Team B Coach calls the 
        Referee over to the players bench. The Coach then informs the Referee that player A#48, 
        who was on the ice at the time of the goal, has its name clearly misspelled on the roster sheet. 
        What are the officials to do?
      answer: >
        The Referees shall disallow the goal and player A#48 shall be ruled off the ice 
        because she is considered to be an ineligible player.
        
        NOTE: Common sense must prevail when making this decision. If, for example, the name in question is 
        MacDonald yet on the roster sheet it was misspelled as McDonald, the spirit of the rule has 
        not been altered and this goal should be allowed. However, if the name in question is 
        Girard and was misspelled as Giroux, then this would not be in the spirit of the rule and 
        the goal would have to be disallowed.

      question: >
        At the 14:00 minute mark of the first period, Team A scores a goal.
        Just before the Referee drops the puck at center ice, the Team B Coach calls the
        Referee over to the players bench. The Coach then informs the Referee that player A#48,
        who was on the ice at the time of the goal, has its name misspelled on the roster sheet.
        The name is MacDonald but the name is spelled McDonald.  What are the officials to do?
      answer: >
        Since the name in question has been accidentally misspelled, the spirit of the rule 
        has not been altered and the referees shall allow the goal.
      rule references:
      - "5.2"
    - number: 5.3.0
      question: > 
        At 12:00 in second period Team A scores a goal. At the stoppage, Team B claims that player A#12
        is not on the 20 skaters list and was on the ice at the time of the goal. 
        They also mentioned that he received an assist on a goal in the first period. 
        What is the Referee's decision?
      answer: >
        If a goal is scored when an ineligible player is on the ice 
        (whether The player was involved in the scoring or not), 
        the goal shall be disallowed. This only applies to the goal scored at the 
        stoppage of play whereby the player was deemed to be ineligible. 
        All other goals scored previously by the ineligible player's team 
        (with the player on ice or not) shall be allowed. 
        The ineligible player will be removed from the game, 
        no additional penalties are to be assessed.
      rule references:
      - "5.2"

      question: > 
        Player A#12 receives a minor and a major early in the second period. 
        Later in the game with A12 back on the ice, Team A scores. 
        While at the Penalty Box the Referees are informed that Player A#12 should 
        have received a game misconduct with her major as it was her second in that same game. 
        What do the Referees do?
      answer: >
        The Referees must disallow the goal for an ineligible player and assess Player A#12
        a game misconduct.
      rule references:
      - "5.2"
    - number: 5.5.0
      question: > 
        Midway through the first period Team A's starting goalkeeper 
        is injured and leaves the game. The backup goalkeeper comes into the game and since Team A 
        has a third goalkeeper in attendance and the starting goalkeeper is injured to the point 
        he will not return, the third goalkeeper dresses and sits on the bench. 
        The second goalkeeper allows three goals but completes the first period. 
        At the start of the second period, the third goalkeeper enters the game. 
        The first two goalkeepers are not present on the bench. 
        What should the officials do?
      answer: >
        Since a team's third goalkeeper may only participate 
        "if both listed goalkeepers are incapacitated" the Referee would have to ask the 
        Coach if the second goalkeeper is injured or sick. 
        If the answer is yes, the third goalkeeper may play, however, 
        if the answer is no, the second goalkeeper must return.
      rule references:

      question: >
        Player A#12 is listed on the roster but with the wrong name 
        (the name is a duplication of another player on the roster). 
        This is brought to the Referee's attention during the game. 
        Is it the name or the number (or both) that must be correct on the roster?
      answer: >
        The name must be correct. Therefore, Player A#12 must be removed from the game.

        Team A is leading 4 - 0. At the 8:59 mark of the first period, Team B informs the Referee that Player A#13 
        is not on the roster sheet. Player A#13 has 3 goals. What does the Referee do?
      answer: >
        Player A#13 would be removed from the game. 
        Since Team B brought it to the Referee's attention at a routine stoppage of play, 
        all goals scored would be allowed.

      question: > 
        Goalkeeper A1 has been assessed a game misconduct penalty early in the first period. 
        Their substitute goalkeeper enters the game and sustains an injury in the second period and cannot continue. 
        Team A does not have a third goalkeeper. Can the first goalkeeper (A1) who was kicked out in the first 
        period enter the game again?
      answer: >
        No. Goalkeeper A1 is ineligible because of the assessment of the game misconduct penalty. 
        Team A may dress one player who was listed on the 20-person roster at the start of the game to be their 
        goalkeeper.

      rule: >
        A Game is contested between two (2) Teams which play under the direction of On-ice and Off-ice Officials.
        A Team shall be composed of twenty-two (22) Players. No more than twenty (20) Skaters and two (2) 
        Goalkeepers shall be permitted. For the purposes of these playing rules, any reference to "Player" 
        shall refer to both Skaters and Goalkeepers. Any reference to "Goal-keeper" shall mean that the section 
        of the rule is specific to Goalkeepers. Prior to the start of each game, the Team Manager, 
        Coach of each Team shall list on a "Line-up / Roster Sheet" the Players who are eligible to play in the game. 
        For a Team to play a game, it must be able to put on the ice at least five (5) Skaters and one (1) Goal-keeper
        at the beginning of the game.  Only eligible Players can be listed on the Roster Sheet and play in a Game.
        Players who are registered for a tournament or event but who are not listed on the Official Game Sheet
        can participate in the pre-game warm-up.
        
        The Coach must submit the "Line-up / Roster Sheet" to the Official Scorekeeper at least sixty (60) 
        minutes prior to the start of the game. The Official Game Sheet with the listed names and numbers of all 
        eligible Players must be handed to the On-ice Game Officials before the Game, and no change shall
        be permitted to the Official Game Sheet after the commencement of the Game.
        Prior to the Game, if an Official (on-ice or off-ice) notices that a Player is in uniform but has not
        been included on the Official Game Sheet, the Referee shall bring this to the attention 
        of the offending Team so that the necessary correction can be made to the Official Game Sheet 
        with no penalty assessed.  At IIHF Championships, a representative from each Team must confirm the
        "Line-up / Roster Sheet" at least two (2) minutes prior to the start of the Game, and Players 
        may be added or deleted up to the "opening face-off".  Game rules will not allow for a Team to have more 
        than six (6) Players (one (1) Goalkeeper and five (5) Skaters) on the ice at any time 
        during game action when the team is not penalized.

        must be correctly listed by the Team Manager or Coach of that Team.
        Whenever an ineligible Player is identified to the Referee, the ineligible Player will be removed from the Game and the Team shall not
        be able to substitute another Player from its Roster.
        No additional penalties are to be assessed but a report of the incident must be submitted to the Proper Authorities. For an ineligible
        Goalkeeper see Rule 5.3 - Goalkeeper.
        If a goal is scored when an ineligible Player is on the ice (whether they were involved in the scoring or not), the goal will be disallowed.
        This only applies to the goal scored at the stoppage of play whereby the Player was deemed to be ineligible. All other goals scored
        previously by the ineligible Player's Team (with them on the ice or not) shall be allowed.
        If a Player is assessed a penalty, and during the penalty they are found to be an ineligible Player, they will be removed from the game
        and another Player of their Team, designated by the Coach, must serve the remainder of the penalty.

        be provided with a reasonable amount of time to get dressed, in addition to a two-minute (2) warm-up (except when they enter the
        game to defend against a "Penalty Shot").

        During the play, if an injured Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players'
        Bench and not through any other exit leading from the Rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs,
        a Bench-minor Penalty shall be imposed.
        
        If a penalized Player has been injured, they may proceed to the Dressing Room without taking a seat in the Penalty Box. The penalized
        Team shall immediately put a substitute Player in the Penalty Box, who shall serve the penalty until the injured Player is able to return
        to the game. They would replace their Teammate in the Penalty Box at the next stoppage of play.
        For violation of this rule, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed.
        
        Should the injured penalized Player who has been replaced in the Penalty Box return to their Players' Bench prior to the expiration of
        their penalty, they shall not be eligible to play until their penalty has expired. This includes coincidental penalties when their substitute
        is still in the Penalty Box awaiting a stoppage in play.

        then eligible to return once their penalty has expired.
        
        When a Player is injured so that they cannot continue play or go to their Players' Bench, the play shall not be stopped until the injured Player's Team has secured control of the puck. If the Player's Team is in "control of the puck" at the time of injury, play shall be
        stopped immediately unless their Team is in a scoring position.
        
        In the case where it is obvious that a Player has sustained a serious injury, the Referee and/or Linesperson may stop the play immediately. Where an injury has occurred to a Player and there is a stoppage of play, a Team Doctor (or other Medical Personnel) may go
        onto the ice to attend to the injured Player without waiting for the Referee's consent.
        
        When play has been stopped by the Referee or Linesperson due to an injured Player, or whenever an injured Player is attended to on

        The use of pads or protectors made of metal, or of any other material likely to cause injury to an opposing Player is prohibited.
        Referees have the authority to prohibit any equipment they feel may cause injury to any participant in the game. Failure to comply
        with the Referees' instructions shall result in a Minor Penalty for "Delay of Game". A mask or protector of a design approved by the
        IIHF may be worn by a Player who has sustained a facial injury.
        In the first instance, the injured Player shall be entitled to wear any protective device prescribed by the Team Doctor. If any opposing
        Team objects to the device, it may record its objection with the IIHF.
        In cases where a stick may have been modified and it is evident that the edges have not been beveled, the Referee shall deem the
        stick to be dangerous equipment and removed from the game until the edges can be beveled sufficiently.
        No penalty is to be assessed unless the Player returns to the ice with the unmodified stick, in which case they will be assessed

      question: >
        A player takes a shot on goal and the goalkeeper juggles the puck and the puck ultimately ends up in the goal. 
        Just before the puck crosses the goal line the Referee notices that the shaft of the stick of the 
        stick of the player who shot the puck is broken. Is this a good goal?
      answer: >
        Unless the Referee can be certain that the stick was broken prior to the shot being taken this goal must stand. 
        If, however, the Referee is certain the stick was broken prior to the shot being taken, 
        the goal would be disallowed, and a minor penalty assessed to the player for participating in the play 
        with a broken stick.

        There is no limit to the number of stick-measurement requests a Team may make in a game, but a request for a stick measurement
        shall be limited to one request per Team during the course of any stoppage in play.
        When a formal complaint is made by the Captain or Alternate Captain of a Team, against the dimensions of an opponent's stick, that
        opponent must be on the ice at the time the request is made to the Referee. It must be specified which part of the stick should be
        measured.
        Once the request is made, and as long as the On-ice Officials maintain visual contact with the stick, it can be measured. This means
        that if the Player whose stick is about to be measured steps off the ice onto their Players' Bench, their stick may still be measured
        provided the request was received prior to them leaving the ice surface and the stick remains in the view of at least one of the On-
        ice Officials.
        The Referee shall take the stick to the Penalty Box where the necessary measurement shall be made immediately. Players on both
        Teams shall retire to their respective Players Benches. To measure the curvature of the blade of the stick, the Referee must draw an
        imaginary line along the outside of the shaft to the bottom of the blade and then along the bottom of the blade - this will determine
        the location of the heel. Using an IIHF-approved measuring gauge, the Referee shall secure the gauge at the heel of the stick and
        measure the curvature of the blade from the heel to any point along the toe of the blade. To measure any other dimension of the stick,
        the Referee shall use a measuring tape.
        The result shall be reported to the Penalty Timekeeper, who shall record it on the Penalty Record form. The Referee will convey the
        result of the measurement to the Captain or Alternate Captain of the Team whose stick was measured.
        A Player whose stick has been measured and it is found not to conform to the rule shall be assessed a Minor Penalty and the stick
        
        will be returned to the Players' Bench by the Referee. If the complaint is not sustained, a Bench Minor Penalty shall be imposed
        against the complaining Team.
        A Player who participates in the play (i.e., checks or prevents the movement of an opponent or who plays the puck) while carrying
        two sticks (including while taking a replacement stick to their Goalkeeper) shall incur a Minor Penalty under this rule.
        A request for a stick measurement in regular playing time is permitted, including after the scoring of a goal. However, a goal cannot
        be disallowed as a result of the measurement.
        A request for a stick measurement following a goal in Overtime (including one scored on a "Penalty Shot" in Overtime) is not permit-
        ted. Stick measurements prior to or during the shootout are permitted, subject to the guidelines outlined in
        
        ➔ Rule 10.7. – STICK MEASUREMENT – PRIOR TO SHOOTOUT ATTEMPT.
        
        Any Player who deliberately breaks their stick or who refuses to surrender their stick for measurement when requested to do so by
        the Referee shall be assessed a Minor Penalty plus a ten-minute (10) Misconduct Penalty.

      title: STICK MEASUREMENT – PRIOR TO "PENALTY SHOT"
      rule: >
        A stick measurement request may be made prior to a "Penalty Shot" following these guidelines:
        If the stick is "legal" the complaining Team is assessed a Bench Minor Penalty, and a Player is placed in the Penalty Box immediately.
        Regardless of the result of the "Penalty Shot", the Bench Minor Penalty is assessed and served.
        If the stick is "illegal" the Player will be assessed a Minor Penalty and must proceed to the Penalty Box immediately to serve their
        penalty. Another Player must take the "Penalty Shot". If the Player refuses to surrender their stick for measurement, the "Penalty
        Shot" shall not be permitted, and the Player shall be assessed a Misconduct Penalty.

      title: SHORT-HANDED
      rule: >
        "Short-handed" means that the Team is below the numerical strength of its opponent on the ice at the time the goal is scored. The
        Minor or Bench Minor Penalty which terminates automatically is the one with the least amount of time on the clock. Thus Coincident
        Minor Penalties to both Teams do not cause either side to be "short-handed" - see Rule 19 – Coincidental Penalties.
        If while a Team is "short-handed" by one or more Minor or Bench Minor Penalties, the opposing Team scores a goal, the first of such
        penalties shall automatically terminate.
        This rule shall also apply when a goal is awarded. This rule does not apply when a goal is scored on a "Penalty Shot" (i.e., offending
        Team's penalized Player(s) do not get released on the scoring of a goal on a "Penalty Shot").
        
        Minor Penalty expiration criteria:
        (I) Is the Team scored against "short-handed"?
        (II) Is the Team scored against serving a Minor Penalty on the clock?
        
        If both criteria are satisfied, the Minor Penalty with the least amount of time on the clock shall terminate except when "Coincidental
        Penalties" are being served.

        What is the on-ice strength of both teams and how do you come to that conclusion?
      answer: >
        All major penalties to Team A are eliminated using the coincidental penalty rule 19. Therefore, Team A must place two players in the Penalty Box and
        to serve the minor penalties to #45 and #14. Team A will play two players short-handed for two minutes. 
        Three of the four major penalties to Team B are eliminated using the coincidental penalty rule. Team B will play one player short-handed for five minutes. The team has the choice to either have #12
        or #52 serve the five-minute time penalty, or they can place another player in the box to serve the extra five-minute penalty assessed to #29.

        By applying the coincidental penalty rule we can determine that Team A will play short-handed for 5 minutes and Team B will plaplay short-handed for 2 minutes. Which Team A player's penalty goes up on the penalty time clock? What is your rationale?
      answer: >
        This is the Team A's choice. However, should the team choose to put #3's penalty on the penalty time clock, they will have to place an additional player in the Penalty Box. If they choose to place #34's penalty on the penalty time clock, the player 
        will be permitted to exit immediately upon the expiration of his major penalty for fighting. No additional player would be required to sit for the major penalty to #3 in this case.

      question: >
        Near the end of the first period, Team A is short-handed by reason of a minor penalty that will carry over into the second period. Just before the buzzer sounds to end the first period, the Referee signals a delayed minor penalty to a player on Team B. 
        The penalty is assessed when the buzzer sounds to end the period (0:00 on the clock). When the teams return to the ice to start the second period, another player on Team A is assessed a minor penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct (20:00 on the clock). 
        What is the on-ice strength to start the period?
      answer: >
        The on-ice strength to start the period is five on four skaters in favor of Team B. The minor penalty assessed to Team B at the end of the first period and the minor penalty assessed to Team A at the start of the second period are deemed to be assessed 
        at the same stop page of play and are therefore coincidental and since Team A was already short-handed, they do not go up on the penalty time clock

      answer: >
        Since two players from Team B were penalized in this situation, Rule 19.4 is not applicable. Therefore, five minutes goes on the penalty clock for Team A and two separate minor penalties go on the penalty clock for Team B and the on-ice strength is four on three in favor of Team A.

        The puck continues to slide towards the goal and the player loops back and picks up the puck and continues 
        towards the goal for the attempt. Is this legal?
      answer: >
        Yes. As long as the puck does not come to a complete stop, the player may retrieve the puck and continue 
        towards the goal in an attempt to score.

        There is a scramble in the crease and a defending team's skater covers the puck with the hand in the crease. This too calls for a Penalty Shot. How should the Referee proceed?

        The Referee shall award two Penalty Shots. However, only one goal can be scored or awarded at a single stoppage of play. Should the first Penalty Shot result in a goal, the second 
        shot would not be taken but the appropriate penalty would be assessed and served for the infraction committed.

        A defending player blocks a shot by the attacking skater and the puck deflects just over the blue line into the neutral zone. The player who blocked the shot has a great 
        opportunity to get to the loose puck and head down the ice on a breakaway. However, the skater is fouled (tripped) just inside the own defensive zone and denied a chance to get 
        to the loose puck. What is the ruling by the Referee?
      answer: >
        Minor penalty for tripping. The player fouled was not yet in the neutral zone and therefore a Penalty Shot cannot be awarded.

        be on a breakaway when the player gets to the loose puck. The player is hooked from behind and the Referee raises the arm for a Penalty Shot. 
        One second after the penalty is signaled the period ends. Even if the Team B player had not been hooked, the player would never have had time to skate down the ice 
        with the puck to make an attempt on the goal. With this fact in mind, is the Penalty Shot still awarded?
      answer: >
        No.A minor penalty for hooking should be called. The rationale is that the since the time in the period expired, the player was never denied a reasonable chance to score, 
        and therefore the foul did not meet all the criteria required to award a Penalty Shot.

        Team B's defensive player come into the zone and join the scrum. The Linespersons effectively 
        break up the scrum and the officials proceed to prepare for the Penalty Shot attempt. 
        The Team B player misses the Penalty Shot attempt. Where is the ensuing face-off? 
        Where is the face-off if, during the same scenario as above, Team B is assessed a minor penalty 
        following the scrum? The Team B player again misses the Penalty Shot attempt.
      answer: >
        Although Rule 24.5 states, "If a goal is not scored, the puck shall be faced-off at either of the 
        end face-off spots in the zone in which the Penalty Shotwastried,"we must consider that following the 
        Penalty Shot being awarded, additional violations of the rules took place. In the first situation above,
        the point players for the attacking team entered the zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone face off 
        circle during an altercation, gathering or "scrum" and therefore, the face-off must be moved to the neutral 
        zone near the blue line of the defending team following the unsuccessful Penalty Shot attempt. 

        In the second situation above, the attacking team is penalized following the awarding of the Penalty Shot.
        Therefore, following the unsuccessful Penalty Shot attempt, the ensuing face-off must be taken to the penalized
        team's (TeamB's) defending zone at one of the end zone face-off spots.

        b. Allow the shot to be re-taken if the player does not score or it could not be determined if the puck has already would have entered the area normally

        player tries to skate past the Team A player who is now in the neutral zone as well. Realizing that the Team B player will be on a breakaway, the Team A player 
        hooks the Team B player. The Referee signals a delayed Penalty Shot. While the delay is on, the Team B player continues on the breakaway. The same Team A player 
        catches the Team B player and again fouls the player from behind denying a reasonable scoring opportunity. What should the Referee do?
      answer: >
        The Referee would assess a Penalty Shot to the Team B player that is fouled to restore the lost scoring opportunity and assess the Team A player an additional 
        minor for hooking. This penalty must be served regardless of whether the shot is successful. NOTE:Two separate fouls (as they relate to Penalty Shots being 
        awarded) means that two things have happened to warrant the assessment of Penalty Shots. For example, a player is fouled from behind on a break away, and then a 
        defending player covers the puck in the crease. These would be two separate foul scalling for a Penalty Shot, and therefore, they would be awarded two Penalty Shots.
        However, in the question above, only one of the two fouls result in a Penalty Shot because only one of the fouls meets all the criteria for a Penalty Shot. Therefore
        The first foul no longer denies the puck carrier a reasonable chance to score since the player can continue on the break away. Therefore, the first foul is assessed as a minor penalty.

        The Referee shall announce the reason for the assessed "Penalty Shot" and shall have the Player selected by the Team entitled to take the "Penalty Shot" announced over the Public Address System.
        The Referee shall then place the puck on the Center Face-off Spot and the Player taking the "Penalty Shot" will, on the instruction
        of the Referee, by blowing their whistle, play the puck from there and shall attempt to score on the Goalkeeper.

        The puck must be kept in motion towards the opponent's Goal Line and once it is shot, the play shall be considered complete.

        No goal can be scored on a rebound of any kind (an exception being the puck off the Goal Post or crossbar, then the Goalkeeper
        and then directly into the goal), and any time the puck crosses the Goal Line or comes to a complete stop, the "Penalty Shot" shall
        be considered complete.

        The "spin-o-rama type move" where the Player completes a 360° turn as they approach the goal, shall not be permitted.

        Should a Player perform such a move during the "Penalty Shot", the shot shall be stopped by the Referee and no goal will be the result.

        Only a Player designated as a Goalkeeper or alternate Goalkeeper may defend against a "Penalty Shot".

        The Goalkeeper must remain in their crease until the Player taking a "Penalty Shot" has touched the puck.

        If at the time a "Penalty Shot" is awarded, the Goalkeeper of the penalized Team has been removed from the ice to substitute another
        Player, the Goalkeeper shall be permitted to return to the ice before the "Penalty Shot" is taken.

        The Team against whom the "Penalty Shot" has been assessed may replace their Goalkeeper to defend against the shot, however,
        the substitute goalkeeper is required to remain in the game until the next stoppage of play.

        Should the Goalkeeper leave their Crease prior to the Player taking the "Penalty Shot" touching the puck, or committing any foul, the
        Referee shall allow the "Penalty Shot" to be taken.

        If the "Penalty Shot" fails, the Referee shall permit the "Penalty Shot" to be taken over again. When an infraction worthy of a Minor
        Penalty is committed by the Goalkeeper during the "Penalty Shot" causing it to fail, no penalty is assessed but the Referee shall permit
        the "Penalty Shot" to be taken over again.

        Should a Goalkeeper commit a second (2nd) violation and the "Penalty Shot" fails, they shall be assessed a Misconduct Penalty and
        the Referee shall permit the "Penalty Shot" to be taken over again.

        A third (3rd) such violation shall result in the Goalkeeper being assessed a Game Misconduct Penalty and a goal shall be awarded.
        When a Major or Match Penalty is committed by the Goalkeeper that causes the shot to fail, the Referee shall permit the "Penalty
        Shot" to be taken over again and the appropriate penalties shall be assessed to the Goalkeeper.

        The Goalkeeper may attempt to stop the "Penalty Shot" in any manner except by throwing their stick or any object, or by deliberately
        dislodging the goal, in which case a goal shall be awarded.

        During the "Penalty Shot", should the Goalkeeper, in an attempt at making a save, dislodge the goal accidentally, the Referee shall
        make one of the following determinations:  
        (I) Award a goal if they deem the Player would have scored into the area normally occupied by the net had it not been dislodged.
        (II) Allow the "Penalty Shot" to be re-taken if they do not score or it could not be determined if the puck would have entered the area normally occupied by the net.
        (III) If the goal becomes dislodged after the puck has crossed the Goal Line thus ending the "Penalty Shot", the above determinations do not apply, the "Penalty Shot" is complete.

        If, while a "Penalty Shot" is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the opposing Team interferes with or distracts the
        Player taking the "Penalty Shot" and, because of such action, the "Penalty Shot" fails, a second (2nd) attempt shall be permitted.

        The Referee shall impose a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team, and if a Player on the Bench is responsible, a Misconduct
        Penalty on the Player responsible shall be assessed. When a Coach or team personnel is guilty of such an act, a Game Misconduct
        Penalty shall be assessed on the responsible person and the matter will be reported to the Proper Authorities for possible further
        disciplinary action.

        If, while the "Penalty Shot" is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the Team taking the "Penalty
        Shot" interferes with or distracts the Goalkeeper defending the "Penalty Shot" and, because of such action, the shot is
        successful, the Referee shall rule no goal and shall impose a Bench Minor Penalty to the offending Team.

        If while the "Penalty Shot" is being taken a spectator throws any object onto the ice that in the judgment of the Referee interferes
        with the Player taking the "Penalty Shot" or the Goalkeeper defending the "Penalty Shot", they shall permit the "Penalty Shot" to be
        taken again. For incidents involving stick measurements refer to:
          ➔ Rule 10.5 Sticks Measurement and ➔ Rule 10.6 – Sticks Measurement – Prior to Penalty Shot.

      title: FACE-OFF LOCATION
      rule: >
        If a goal is scored from a "Penalty Shot", the puck shall be faced-off at Center ice. If a goal is not scored, the puck shall be faced-off
        at either of the end Face-off Spots in the zone in which the "Penalty Shot" was attempted, except when another rule dictates the
        "face-off" location should be in an alternate location, such as when the "point men" enter the zone beyond the outer edge of the End -
        Zone Face-off Circle or when the attacking Team has been penalized on the same play.

      title: RESULTS
      rule: >
        Should a goal be scored from a "Penalty Shot", a further penalty to the offending Player shall not be applied unless the offense
        for which the "Penalty Shot" was awarded is a Major, Match or Misconduct Penalty, in which case the appropriate penalty shall be
        imposed.

        If the offense for which the "Penalty Shot" was awarded would normally incur a Minor Penalty, then regardless of the outcome of the
        "Penalty Shot", no further Minor Penalty shall be served.

        Should a goal be scored from a "Penalty Shot", a further penalty to the offending Player shall not be applied unless the offense
        for which the "Penalty Shot" was awarded is a Major, Match or Misconduct Penalty, in which case the appropriate penalty shall be
        imposed.

        If the offense for which the "Penalty Shot" was awarded would normally incur a Minor Penalty, then regardless of the outcome of the
        "Penalty Shot", no further Minor Penalty shall be served.

      title: TIMING
      rule: >
        If the foul upon which the "Penalty Shot" is based occurs during actual playing time, the "Penalty Shot" shall be awarded and taken
        immediately in the usual manner notwithstanding any delay occasioned by a slow whistle by the Referee to allow play to continue
        until the attacking side has lost possession of the puck to the defending side, to which this delay results in the expiry of the regular
        playing time in any period.
        The time required for the taking of a "Penalty Shot" shall not be included in the regular playing time or Overtime.
    - number: 24.8
      title: INFRACTIONS
      rule: >
        When a Player, in the Neutral or Attacking Zone, in "control" of the puck (or who could have obtained "possession and control" of
        the puck) and having no other opponent to pass than the Goalkeeper, is fouled from behind, thus preventing a reasonable scoring
        opportunity, a "Penalty Shot" shall be awarded to the non-offending Team.

        Nevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking Team has "lost possession" of the puck to the defending Team.
        The intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable "scoring opportunity" which has been lost. If, however, the Player fouled is able to
        recover and obtain a "reasonable scoring opportunity" (or a Teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no "Penalty
        Shot" should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play.

        "Control of the puck" means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand, or feet.

        In order for a "Penalty Shot" to be awarded for a Player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met:
        (I) The infraction must have taken place in the Neutral or Attacking Zone (i.e., over the puck carrier's own Blue Line);
        (II) The infraction must have been committed from behind (except a foul committed from the front by the Goalkeeper on a
        "breakaway" situation);
        (III) The Player in "possession and control" (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have "obtained possession
        and control" of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score. The fact that the Player got a shot
        off does not automatically eliminate this play from the "Penalty Shot" consideration criteria. If the foul was from behind
        and the Player was denied a "more reasonable scoring opportunity" due to the foul, then the "Penalty Shot" should still
        be awarded;
        (IV) The Player in "possession and control" (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have "obtained possession
        and control") must have had no opposing Player between themself and the Goalkeeper.
        
        If, in the opinion of the Referee, a Player makes contact with the puck first and subsequently trips the opponent in so doing, no "Penalty
        Shot" will be awarded, but a Minor Penalty for "tripping" shall be assessed.

        It should be noted that if the attacking Player manages to get around the Goalkeeper and has no defending Player between them and
        the "open goal", and they are fouled from behind by the Goalkeeper or another defending Player, no goal can be awarded since the
        Goalkeeper is still on the ice. A "Penalty Shot" would be awarded.

        Player A #16 is on a breakaway in the neutral zone. Team B's goalkeeper has been removed for an extra attacker. 
        Player A #16 is fouled from behind calling for an Awarded Goal. Before the Referee can blow the whistle to stop play and 
        award the goal to Team A, Player A #16 slashes the Team B player who made the foul from behind, worthy of a minor penalty. 
        What action should be taken by the Referee?
      answer: >
        The goal is to be awarded to Team A. The slashing penalty to Player A #16 is to be assessed in the normal fashion.

      question: >
        During a Shootout attempt, player "A" proceeds towards the net and the goalie for Team "B". As player "A" attempts to 
        deke the goalie, the goalie from Team "B" takes the fake and slides into the goal post dislodging the net from pegs.
        As the net becomes dislodged, the shooter pulls the puck back to the forehand side and directs the puck towards the open net. 
        As the net had become dislodged before the puck crossed the goal line, is this an Awarded Goal or a dead play?
      answer: >
        "When Goal keeper is on Ice"– A goal will be awarded when an attacking player,with an imminent scoring opportunity 
        is prevented from scoring because of a defending player or goalkeeper displacing the goal post, either deliberately or 
        accidentally.

        As this occurs, Player A #5 is winding up for a shot, the puck crosses the line into the net but before it does the net is comes off its pegs. 
        Does the goal count?
      answer: >
        Yes, this goal counts. If the goal posts are displaced intentionally or accidentally by a defending player,prior to the puck crossing the line,
        the Referee may award a goal. The player must have an imminent scoring opportunity for the goal to be awarded.

        The player that is to be released is Player A #6, however, the Penalty Box Attendant lets Player A #7 out of the Penalty Box in error. 
        The Linesperson sees this and knows that the wrong player has been released. What should the Linesperson do?
      answer: >
        To avoid a potentially embarrassing situation for the officials, the Linesperson should stop the play once Team A gains control of the puck
        and notify the Referees so that the situation can be rectified. Since it was an error by the Off-Ice Official, no additional penalty would be 
        assessed to Team A.

      answer: >
        Yes,the goalkeeper may continue in the Shootout. All players are eligible to participate in the Shootout unless they are serving a penalty. 
        Since a goalkeeper does not actually "serve" a ten-minute misconduct, the goalkeeper may continue in the Shootout. However, the player 
        designated to serve the misconduct for the goalkeeper becomes ineligible to participate in the Shootout(which would also be true if the 
        player is serving the goalkeeper's misconduct at the  time the Shootout begins).  

        NOTE: when the goalkeeper is assessed the misconduct during the Shootout,the team must designate a player who has not yet participated
        in the Shootout to serve the misconduct. This is consistent with the procedure during the game where by the team of the penalized 
        goalkeeper is required to lose the services of a player for the duration of the goalkeeper's penalty(ies).

        The IIHF will designate an Off-ice Official to serve in the role of Video Review Consultant in every arena for every game. The Video Review Consultant will be located in a secluded area in the upper level of the building with an unobstructed view of both goals.
        The location must be large enough to seat four (4) people (Video Review Consultant, Video Review Technician, Officiating Coach and IIHF Officiating Representative) and must have space for necessary monitors, replay and recording equipment.
        The Video Review Consultant and Officiating Coach shall both have access to all replays that may be available from all available broadcasts of the game.
        The Video Review Consultant and Officiating Coach shall also be equipped with state-of-the-art communications systems that will allow direct and immediate access to the Off-ice Official(s) at the Penalty Box and the On-ice Official(s).

      title: GOAL REVIEW PROCEDURES
      rule: >     
        Every goal shall be reviewed by the IIHF Video Review Operations. If there is a need to delay the resumption of the play following an apparent goal, the Off-Ice Official at ice level will be alerted to signal one of the Referees to delay the Center-ice “face-off” for a moment. Once the IIHF Video Review Operations has reviewed the video and confirmed that the goal is valid, the Off-ice Official at ice level should signal to the Referee to resume play.
        If an expanded review is required on any potential goal, the IIHF Video Review Operations shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded and the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that the “play is under review.” Once the play has been reviewed and deemed a goal, the goal will be announced in the normal manner.
        If the review reveals that the goal should be disallowed, the Referee shall announce the reason for the disallowed goal.
        When the IIHF Video Review Operations observes an incident involving a potential goal that was undetected by the On-ice Officials, the Off-ice Official will contact the Referee at the first stoppage of play and inform them that a review of the play is in progress.
        When a video review is initiated, the Public Address Announcer will make an announcement that “the play is under review.”
        Should the Video Review Operations be able to determine that a goal has been scored through the use of video replay, and play on the ice has nonetheless continued, the Video Review Operations shall instruct that the in-arena horn be sounded to stop play immediately, and the goal will be awarded.
        Should the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal coincide with the end of a period, the On-ice Official(s) will instruct both Teams to remain at their respective Players’ Bench until the Video Review of the play can be completed.
        If the review reveals that the goal should be counted, the clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time the goal was scored.
        If the review reveals that no goal was scored, no adjustment to the time clock(s) will be made. Only one goal can be awarded at any stoppage of play.
        If an apparent goal was scored by Team A and is subsequently confirmed as a goal by the IIHF Video Review Operations, any goal scored by Team B during the period of time between the apparent goal by Team A and the stoppage of play (Team B’s goal), the Team B goal will not be awarded.
        If the apparent goal by Team A is deemed to have entered the goal illegally (e.g., a “distinct kicking motion”), the goal will be disallowed by the IIHF Video Review Operations; no goal will be awarded to Team B either in this circumstance since the play should have been stopped at the time of the apparent goal. The clock (including penalty time clocks, if applicable) shall be reset to the time of Team A’s apparent goal – whether awarded or disallowed.
        Any penalties signaled during the period of time between the apparent goal and the next stoppage of play shall be assessed in the normal manner, except when a Minor Penalty is to be assessed to the Team scored upon and is therefore nullified by the scoring of the goal – refer to ➔ Rule 16.2. – Minor Penalties, ➔ Rule 18.2. – Double-minor Penalties.
        If an infraction happens after the first stoppage of play following an apparent goal (infraction after the whistle) by either Team, it is assessed and served in the normal manner regardless as to the decision rendered by Video Review.
        When the Referee indicates there is a Video Review in progress, all Players (with the exception of the Goalkeepers) should proceed to their respective Players’ Bench immediately, and failure to do so may result in a Game Misconduct Penalty for offending Player(s) and shall be reported to the Proper Authorities.
        Any potential goal requiring Video Review must be reviewed prior to and/or during the next stoppage of play. No goal may be awarded (or disallowed) as a result of a Video Review once the puck has been dropped and play has resumed.
        The IIHF Video Review Operations will connect directly with the Referee(s) at ice level to assist with the review of any close play or disputed goal. The On-ice Officials (Referees or Linespersons) decision shall be final.

        (VI) Puck deflected directly into the net of an On-ice Official
        (VII) Puck struck or deflected into the net with a high-stick, above the height of the crossbar
        (VIII) Puck entering the net in a proper manner through goal mouth (ensuring puck did not enter net improperly through net meshing or underneath the net frame, etc.)
        (IX) Puck entering the net as the culmination of a continuous play where the result of the play was unaffected by any whistle blown by the Referee upon their losing sight of the puck; and
        (X) The legitimacy of all potential goals on “Penalty Shot” or “Penalty Shot” Shootout attempts to ensure compliance with applicable rules (e.g., Goalkeeper leaving crease prior to puck touch at Center ice, Goalkeeper throwing stick, Goalkeeper dislodging goal, shooter cradling puck above the normal height of the shoulders, shooter performing illegal “spin-o-rama” move, Skater’s continued forward advancement of puck, “double-tap”/ “rebound”, etc.)

      title: DISTINCT KICKING MOTION
      rule: >
        Plays that involve a puck entering the net as a direct result of a “distinct kicking motion” shall be ruled “no goal”. A “distinct kicking motion,” for purposes of Video Review, is one where the video makes clear that an attacking Player has deliberately propelled the puck with a kick of their foot or skate and the puck subsequently enters the net. A goal cannot be scored on a play where an attacking Player propels the puck with their skate into the net (even by means of a subsequent deflection off another Player, unless from a stick of a skater) using a “distinct kicking motion”.
        A goal also cannot be scored on a play where an attacking Player kicks any equipment (stick, glove, helmet, etc.) at the puck, including kicking the blade of their own stick, causing the puck to cross the Goal Line.
        A puck that deflects into the net off an attacking Player’s skate who does not use a “distinct kicking motion” shall be ruled a “good goal”.
        A puck that is directed into the net by an attacking Players’ skate shall also be ruled a “good goal”, as long as no “distinct kicking motion” is evident.

        There shall be one Goal Judge situated behind each goal (or in an area designated and approved by the IIHF), in properly protected areas, if possible, so that there can be no interference with their activities. They shall not change goals during the game.
        The Goal Judge shall signal, normally by means of red light, a decision as to whether the puck passed between the Goal Posts and entirely over the Goal Line.
        The only decision the Goal Judge must make is whether the puck actually entered the net, not how or when it went in.
        The light must be illuminated for a period of five (5) seconds each time the puck enters the net regardless of circumstances. It is up to the Referee to make the final decision.

      title: COACH'S CHALLENGE INITIATED BY THE IIHF VIDEO REVIEW OPERATIONS
      rule: > 
        In the final minute of play in the 3rd Period and at any point in Overtime, the IIHF Video Review Operations will initiate the review of any scenario that would otherwise be subject to a Coach’s Challenge.
        The IIHF Video Review Operations will continue to be responsible for the review of all goals subject to Video Review.
        ➔ Rule 37 – Video Review. TABLE OF CONTENTS
        
        Where a Coach’s Challenge is available on a scoring play potentially involving “Off-side,” a “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Offensive Zone” or “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” the IIHF Video Review Operations will, as an initial and threshold matter, determine that the puck entered the net legally before the play will be subject to further review by means of a Coach’s Challenge (or, in the final minute of play or in Overtime, a review initiated by the IIHF Video Review Operations)
    - number: "38.4"
      title: PROCESS FOR INITIATING A COACH’S CHALLENGE
      rule: > 
        All Coach’s Challenges must be initiated by notice verbally communicated to a Referee prior to the Center ice “face-off” following a “goal” or, in the case of a “no goal” call by reason of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” prior to the resumption of play.
        Teams may not unduly delay the resumption of play while evaluating whether or not to initiate a Coach’s Challenge. Any such delay or delay tactics may result in the denial of a right to Challenge and, at the discretion of the Referee, may also result in a Bench Minor Penalty for “Delaying the Game”.
        ➔ Rule 63 – Delaying the Game.
        In order to expedite the review process, Coaches initiating a Coach’s Challenge are required to provide to the Referee, with reasona- ble specificity, both the reason for their Coach’s Challenge (i.e., the actual infraction that is being claimed) and the approximate time on the clock when the purported infraction transpired. Failure to provide this information with reasonable specificity may result in the denial of a right to a Coach’s Challenge.
        Only one Coach’s Challenge per Team per stoppage will be permitted.

      title: PROCESS FOR REVIEWING A COACH'S CHALLENGE
      rule: > 
        The IIHF Technology Department in cooperation with the Organizer will make available in all arenas suitable technology (for example, a handheld tablet or a television or computer monitor) that will allow the On-ice Officials, in conjunction with the IIHF Video Review Operations, to review video replays of the play giving rise to the Coach’s Challenge (or, in the final minute of play or in Overtime, the play that caused the IIHF Video Review Operations to initiate the review).
        To the extent practical and possible, the replays made available to the On-ice Officials will be the same replays that are being utilized by the IIHF Video Review Operations.
        
        Once a Coach’s Challenge has been initiated (or, in the final minute of play or in Overtime, a review is initiated by the IIHF Video Review Operations), the IIHF Video Review Operations will immediately establish contact with the On-ice Official(s) responsible for the call (or non-call) on the ice via the headset and will inquire and discuss with the On-ice Official(s), prior to the On-ice Official reviewing any video, the following:
        (I) the On-ice Official’s “final call on the ice”; and
        (II) what the On-ice Official(s) observed on the play.
        
        The Video Review Consultant will be involved both in communicating with the On-ice Officials via the headset and with providing input to the On-ice Officials (Referees and Linespersons). The On-ice Officials are responsible for making the “final” decision.
        The “on-ice call” will then be reviewed simultaneously by the appropriate On-ice Official(s) at ice level and by the Video Review Consultant, as a part of the IIHF Video Review Operations, using any and all replays at their disposal.
        After their joint review and consultation, the On-ice Officials (Referees or Linespersons) will render the decision on whether to uphold or overturn the original “call on the ice”.
        
        Once a decision is made, the Referee will inform the Penalty Timekeeper/Public Address Announcer and will make the announce- ment on the ice.

      title: RIGHT TO INITIATE A COACH'S CHALLENGE
      rule: > 
        Teams may initiate a Coach’s Challenge on appropriate plays at any time during the game except during the final minute of play in Regulation time or at any time during Overtime, at which point the exclusive right to initiate a review of any scenario that would otherwise be subject to a Coach’s Challenge shifts to the IIHF Video Review Operations.
    - number: "38.7"
      title:  RESULTS OF A SUCCESSFUL COACH'S CHALLENGE
      rule: > 
        In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for an “Off-side-Play Leading to a Goal” or a “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Offensive Zone Leading to a Goal” (either by a Team or by the IIHF Video Review Operations), and a determination is made that the GOAL call on the ice should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed and the clock will be re-set to the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction.
        In such cases, a “face-off” will ensue in the ice location where it would have otherwise occurred had the on-ice infraction been called properly. If one or more penalties (Minor or Major) are assessed between the time of the missed infraction and the Video Review that disallows the apparent goal, the offending Team(s) (and responsible Player(s)) will still be required to serve the penalty(ies) identified and assessed, and the time of the penalty(ies) will be recorded as the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction.
        In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “goal” call on the ice where the defending Team claims that the goal should have been disallowed due to the “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in ➔ Rules 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper, and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed, and a “face-off” will ensue in the nearest Neutral Zone Face-off Spot outside the Attacking Zone.
        The Video Review process on these plays (whether initiated by way of a Coach’s Challenge or by the IIHF Video Review Operations in the final minute of play or in Overtime) will be utilized exclusively for purposes of overturning a “goal” call on the ice – it will not be utilized for any other purpose, including, specifically, for assessing Minor or Major Penalties for Goalkeeper Interference.
        In cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-ice Officials have determined that the attacking Team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” and a determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be allowed an a “face-off” will ensue at Center ice.
        ➔ Rule 69 – "Interference on a goalkeeper"
        If a penalty for “Interference on a Goalkeeper” was indicated and based on the Video Review, no such action was committed by the attacking Player, no penalty shall be assessed for such an infraction.
        All other penalties not related to “Interference on a Goalkeeper” should be assessed and served in a normal manner. On the other hand, penalties not indicated cannot be assessed due to the Video Review.

      title: RESULTS OF AN UNSUCCESSFUL COACH'S CHALLENGE
      rule: > 
        If a Team initiates a Coach’s Challenge for any of the enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 above and such Challenge does not result in the “final call on the ice” being overturned, the Team exercising such Challenge shall be assessed a Bench Minor Penalty
        (2 minutes) for Delaying the Game. If a Team that has already initiated one or more Coach’s Challenges that were unsuccessful, initiates a Coach’s Challenge for any of the enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 above and such Challenge does not result in the original call on the ice being overturned, the Team exercising such a Coach’s Challenge shall be assessed a Double-Bench Minor Penalty (4 minutes) for Delaying the Game.
        Note: If a situation cannot be reviewed by the on-ice officials due to a technical error (e.g. a "black screen"), the "final call on the ice" will stand. In this case, the Coach's Challenge will be considered “unsuccessful” but no Bench Minor Penalty will be assessed on the team that initiated the challenge
    - number: "38.9"
      title: APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR "OFF-SIDE" CHALLENGE
      rule: > 
        The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Linespersons), after revie- wing any and all available replays and consulting with the IIHF Video Review Operations, determine that one or more Players on the attacking Team preceded the puck into the Attacking Zone prior to the goal being scored and that, as a result, the play should have been stopped for an “Off-side” infraction; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed.
        Goals will only be subject to review for a potential “Off-side” infraction if the puck does not come out of the Attacking Zone again between the time of the “Off-side” infraction and the time the goal is scored.
    - number: "38.10"
      title: APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR "MISSED GAME STOPPAGE EVENT IN THE ATTACKING ZONE" CHALLENGE
      rule: > 
        The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all available replays and consulting with the IIHF Video Review Operations determine that the play should have been stopped for a event caused by the attacking team, but was not at some point after the puck entered the Attacking Zone but prior to the goal being scored; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed.
        Potential infractions that would require a play stoppage in the Attacking Zone by the attacking team, includes but may not be limited to: ➔ Rule 79 – Hand Pass; ➔ Rule 80 – High-sticking the Puck; and ➔ Rule 85 – Puck Out of Bounds. Such infractions will only serve as a basis for overturning a “goal” call on the ice if Video Review can conclusively establish that a game stoppage event had occurred in the Attacking Zone and was missed by the On-ice Official(s).
        Where the infraction at issue was a missed penalty call subject to the judgment or discretion of the On-ice Official(s), such infraction cannot result in the “goal” call on the ice being overturned, even if upon review, the On-ice Official(s) would have made a different call. Goals will only be reviewed for a potential “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone” if the puck does not come out of the Attacking Zone again between the time of the “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone” and the time the goal is scored.
    - number: "38.11"
      title: APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR POTENTIAL "INTERFERENCE ON THE GOALKEEPER" CHALLENGE
      rule: > 
        The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all replays and consulting with the IIHF Video Review Operations, determine that the goal should have been disallowed due to “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in ➔ Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed.
        The standard for overturning the call in the event of a “no goal” call on the ice is that the On-ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any and all replays and consulting with the IIHF Video Review Operations, determine that the goal on the ice should have been allowed because either:
        
        (I) There was no actual contact of any kind initiated by the attacking Player with the Goalkeeper; or
        (II) The attacking Player was pushed, shoved or fouled by the defending Player causing the attacking Player to come into contact with the Goalkeeper; or
        (III) The attacking Player’s positioning within the Goal Crease did not impair the Goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal and, in fact, had no discernable impact on the play; where this standard is met, the goal will be allowed.

        The severity of the penalty, based upon the impact with the Boards, shall be at the discretion of the Referee. There is a considerable amount of judgment involved in the application of this rule by the Referees. The duty is on the Player applying the check to ensure their opponent is not in a defenseless position and if so, they must avoid or minimize contact. However, in determining whether such contact could have been avoided, the circumstances of the check, including whether the opponent put themself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the check or whether the check was unavoidable can be considered. This balance must be considered by the Referees when applying this rule.
        Any unnecessary contact with a Player playing the puck on an obvious "icing" or "off-side" play which results in that Player hitting or impacting the Boards is "boarding" and must be penalized as such.

        Charging shall mean the actions of a Player who either jumps to check an opponent, builds up speed by taking multiple strides immediately prior to making contact and / or travels an excessive distance with the sole purpose of delivering such a hit and/or violently checks an opponent in any manner. A "charge" may be the result of a check into the Boards, into the goal frame or in open ice.
        Any unnecessary contact with a Player playing the puck on an obvious "icing" or "off-side" play which results in that Player hitting or impacting the Boards is "boarding" and must be penalized as such. In other instances where there is no contact with the Boards, it should be treated as "charging."
        This rule is superseded by all similar actions regarding an "illegal hit to the head", except those related to "fighting". A penalty shall be imposed on a Player who charges a Goalkeeper while the Goalkeeper is within their Goal Crease.
        A Goalkeeper is not "fair game" just because they are outside the Goal Crease area. The appropriate penalty should be assessed in every case where an opposing Player makes unnecessary contact with a Goalkeeper. However, incidental contact, at the discretion of the Referee, will be permitted when the Goalkeeper is in the act of playing the puck outside their Goal Crease, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact.

        (IV) A Player who jumps (leaves their skates) to deliver a blow to the head or neck of an opponent. In determining whether contact with an opponent's head was avoidable, the circumstances of the hit including the following shall be considered:
        (V) Whether the Player attempted to hit squarely through the opponent's body and the head was not "picked" as a result of poor timing, poor angle of approach, or unnecessary extension of the body upward or outward. If the primary force of a blow is initially to the body area and then contact slides up to the head or neck.
        (VI) Whether the opponent put themself in a vulnerable position by assuming a posture that made head contact on an otherwise full body check unavoidable.
        (VII) Whether the opponent materially changed the position of their body or head immediately prior to or simultaneously with the hit in a way that significantly contributed to the head contact.

      title: INTERFERENCE
      rule: >
        A Player who obstructs or prevents an opponent "without possession of the puck" from skating, receiving a pass, or moving about the ice freely is considered as "interference".
        A "late-hit" constitutes reckless endangerment of a Player who "no longer has control or possession of the puck".
        Any Player who is in the process of "abandoning" or "losing control or possession of the puck" is subject to a bodycheck so long as the aggressor is in the immediate vicinity of the Skater with the puck.
        A strict standard on acts of interference must be adhered to in all areas of the Rink.
        
        Body Position: 
          "Body position" shall be determined as the Player skating in front of or beside their opponent, traveling in the same direction. A Player who is behind an opponent, who does not have the puck, may not use their stick, body, or free hand in order to restrain their opponent, but must skate in order to gain or reestablish their "proper position" in order to make a check.
          A Player is allowed the ice they are standing on (body position) and are not required to move in order to let an opponent proceed. A Player may "block the path" of an opponent provided they are in front of their opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving laterally and without "establishing body position", then making contact with the non-puck carrier is not permitted and will be penalized as "interference". A Player is always entitled to use their "body position" to lengthen an opponent's path to the puck, provided their stick is not utilized (to make themself "bigger" and therefore considerably lengthening the distance their opponent must travel to get where they are going); their "free hand" is not used, and they do not take advantage of their "body position" to deliver an otherwise illegal check.
        
        Possession of the Puck: 
          The last Player to touch the puck, other than the Goalkeeper, shall be considered the Player in "possession". The Player deemed in "possession" of the puck may be checked legally, provided the check is rendered immediately following them "loss of control" and their opponent still finds themself within an "objectively reasonable window of opportunity" to deliver such a check refer to Rule 56.4 – Interference.
        
        Restrain: 
          The actions of a Player who does not have "body position", but instead uses illegal means (e.g., "hook" with stick; "hold" with hands, "trip" with the stick or in any manner) to impede an opponent who is not in "possession" of the puck. Illegal means are acts which allow a Player to "establish, maintain or restore body position" other than by skating.
        
        Pick:
          A "pick" is the action of a Player who checks an opponent who is not in "possession" of the puck and is unaware of the impending check/hit.
          A Player who is aware of an impending hit, not deemed to be a legal "battle for the puck," may not be interfered with by a Player delivering a "pick."
          A Player delivering a "pick" is one who moves into an opponent's path without initially having "body position", thereby taking them "out of the play". When this is done, an "interference" penalty shall be assessed.
        
        Free Hand:
          When a "free hand" is used to hold, pull, tug, grab or physically restrain an opponent from moving "freely", this must be penalized as "holding". The "free hand" may be used by a Player to "fend off" an opponent or their stick but may not be used to hold an opponent's stick or body.
        
        Stick:
          A Player who does not have "body position" on their opponent, who uses their stick (either the blade or the shaft, including the butt-end of the shaft) to impede or prevent their opponent from moving "freely" on the ice shall be assessed a "hooking" penalty.

      rule: >
        A Minor Penalty for "Delay of Game" shall be assessed:
        (I) On any Player, including the Goalkeeper, who holds, "freezes" or plays the puck with their stick, skates or body in such
        a manner as to deliberately cause a stoppage of play. Regarding to a Goalkeeper, this rule applies outside of their Goal Crease area;
        (II) On any Player who deliberately shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck outside the playing area (from anywhere on the ice surface) during the play or after a stoppage of play;
        (III) On any Player who shoots or bats (using their hand or stick) the puck directly (non-deflected) out of the playing surface from their Defending Zone, except where there is no Protective Glass.
        The determining factor shall be the position of the puck when it was shot or batted by the offending Player. If contact with the puck occurs while the puck is inside the Defending Zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the Minor Penalty shall be assessed. When the puck is shot over the Protective Glass surrounding the Players' Bench, the penalty will be assessed. Note: When the puck is shot into the Players' Bench, the penalty will not apply. When the puck goes out of the playing area directly off a "face-off", no penalty shall be assessed;
        (IV) On any Player who delays the game by deliberately displacing a Goal Post from its normal position. The Referee shall stop play immediately when the offending Team gains "control" of the puck.
        Note: If a Player deliberately displaces a Goal Post from its normal position when an opponent has an imminent scoring opportunity on an open net, a goal may be awarded by the Referee ➔ Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal,
        (V) On a Player other than the Goalkeeper who deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body; Note: Any Player who drops to their knees to block a shot should not be penalized if the puck is shot under them or becomes lodged in their clothing or equipment but any use of the hands to make the puck unplayable should be penalized promptly;
        (VI) On a Goalkeeper who "races out" of their Goal Crease in an attempt to beat the attacking Player to the puck and instead of playing the puck jumps on the puck causing a stoppage of play; Note: If a Goalkeeper comes out of their Goal Crease to "cut down the angle" on a shot and after making the save covers the puck, this shall be legal.
        (VII) On a Goalkeeper who, when they are in their own Goal Crease, deliberately falls on or gathers the puck into their body or who holds or places the puck against any part of the goal in such a manner as to cause a stoppage of play unless they are actually being checked by an opponent;
        (VIII) On a Goalkeeper who plays the puck outside of the Designated Area behind the net. The determining factor shall be the position of the puck. Note: The Minor Penalty will not be assessed when a Goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining skate contact with the Goal Crease.
        (IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks. Note: No penalty should be assessed when a water bottle is delivered to a Goalkeeper, however, this should be conducted during time-outs and if, in the opinion of the Referee, it is being done to intentionally delay the game, a Minor Penalty may be assessed.
        (X) No delay shall be permitted for the repair or adjustment of Goalkeeper's equipment. If adjustments are required, the Goalkeeper shall leave the ice and their place shall be taken by the substitute Goalkeeper immediately. For an infraction of this rule by a Goalkeeper, a Minor Penalty shall be imposed.

        The resulting "face-off" will take place at a Face-off Spot in the zone nearest the location where the play was stopped, unless it is in the non-offending Team's Defending Zone, and as such the ensuing "face-off" would be outside the Blue Line at one of the Face-off Spots in the Neutral Zone.
        It is possible for a goal to be scored at one end of the Rink, while the net at the other end has been dislodged, provided that the Team being scored upon is the Team responsible for dislodging the net at the other end of the Rink.

        If by reason of insufficient time in the regular playing time or by reason of penalties already imposed, the Minor Penalty assessed to a Player for deliberately displacing their own Goal Post cannot be served in its entirety within the regular playing time of the game or at any time in Overtime, a "Penalty Shot" shall be awarded against the offending Team.
        No defending Player, except the Goalkeeper, will be permitted to fall on the puck, hold the puck, pick up the puck, or gather the puck into the body or hands when the puck is within the Goal Crease. For infringement of this rule, play shall immediately be stopped and a "Penalty Shot" shall be ordered against the offending Team, but no other penalty shall be given. The rule shall be interpreted so that a "Penalty Shot" will be awarded only when the puck is in the Goal Crease at the instant the offense occurs. However, in cases where the puck is outside the Goal Crease, Rule 63 may still apply and a Minor Penalty may be imposed, even
        though no "Penalty Shot" is awarded. The significant factor when determining whether or not a "Penalty Shot" is warranted is the location of the puck at the time it was held, grabbed or gathered into the body. If the puck is in the Goal Crease, a "Penalty Shot" shall be awarded. If the puck is outside the Goal Crease and gathered into the body of a Player (other than the Goalkeeper) who is inside the Goal Crease, a Minor Penalty shall be assessed.

        In the event the Goal Post is displaced, either "deliberately" or "accidentally", by a defending Player, prior to the puck crossing the Goal Line between the normal position of the goalposts, the Referee may award a goal.
        In order to award a goal in this situation, the Goal Post must have been displaced by the actions of a defending Player, the attacking Player must have "an imminent scoring opportunity" prior to the Goal Post being displaced, and it must be determined that the puck would have entered the Goal between the normal position of the Goal Posts.
        If the Goal Post is deliberately displaced by a Goalkeeper during the course of a "break-away," a goal will be awarded to the non offending Team.
        When the Goal Post has been displaced deliberately by the defending Team when their Goalkeeper has been removed for an extra attacker thereby preventing an impending goal by the attacking Team, the Referee shall award a goal to the attacking Team.
        The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal.
    - number: "63.8"
      title: NO LINE CHANGE
      rule: >
        In the event the Goal Post is displaced accidentally by a defending Player causing a stoppage in play, the ensuing "face-off" shall be conducted at one of the End Zone Face-off Spots in the Defending Zone. The offending Team shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the "face-off". However, a Team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a Goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the "on-ice strength" of either Team.
        In the event the puck is shot into the End Zone by the attacking Team from their own side of the Center Line, and the opposing Goalkeeper freezes the puck resulting in a stoppage of play, the ensuing "face-off" shall be conducted at one of the End Zone Face-off Spots in the Goalkeeper's Defending Zone. The defending Team shall not be permitted to make any player substitutions prior to the "face-off". However, a Team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the "on-ice strength" of either Team.
        In addition, for both situations outlined in this section, for the ensuing "face-off" in the Defending Zone, the attacking Team will have the choice of which End Zone Face-off Spot the "face-off" will take place.

        Player on a breakaway is hooked from behind but clearly goes down easy,

        If you as the Referee believe that the player embellished the infraction, what action should you take?
      answer: >
        The fact that the player has embellished the fall should negate the fact that the player was "denied a 
        reasonable chance to score". As such, a minor penalty should be assessed for the original hook and a 
        minor penalty for diving assessed to the player that embellished the hook.

      title: INTERFERENCE ON THE GOALKEEPER
      rule: >  
        This rule is based on the premise that an attacking Player's position, whether inside or outside the Goal Crease, should not, by itself, determine whether a goal should be allowed or disallowed. In other words, goals scored while attacking Players are standing in the Goal Crease may, in appropriate circumstances be allowed. 
        
        Goals should be disallowed only if:
        (I) an attacking Player, either by their positioning or by a "relevant contact", impairs the Goalkeeper's ability to move freely within their Goal Crease or defend their goal; or
        (II) an attacking Player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a Goalkeeper, inside or outside of their Goal Crease.
        
        "Incidental contact" with a Goalkeeper will be permitted, and resulting goals allowed, when such contact is initiated outside of the

        Goal Crease, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact.

        The rule will be enforced exclusively in accordance with the on-ice judgement of the Referee(s), but may be subject to a Video
        Review: ➔ Rule 37 – Video Review, when applicable or to a Coach's Challenge ➔ Rule 38 – Coach's Challenge.
        For purposes of this rule, "contact / relevant contact" whether "incidental or otherwise", shall mean any contact that is made between or among a Goalkeeper and attacking Player(s), whether by means of a stick or any part of the body. The overriding rationale of this rule is that a Goalkeeper should have the ability to move freely within their Goal Crease without being hindered by the actions of an attacking Player.
        If an attacking Player enters the Goal Crease and, by their actions, impairs the Goalkeeper's ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.
        If an attacking Player is in the Goal Crease and does not leave immediately, the Referee has the possibility to stop the game and the subsequent "face-off" shall take place at the nearest Neutral Zone Face-off Spot outside the Attacking Zone of the offending Team. If an attacking Player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by a defending Player so as to cause them to come into contact with the Goalkeeper, such contact will not be deemed contact initiated by the attacking Player for purposes of this rule, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact.
        If a defending Player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by an attacking Player so as to cause the defending Player to come into contact with their own Goalkeeper, such contact shall be deemed contact initiated by the attacking Player for purposes of this rule, and if necessary, a penalty assessed to the attacking Player and if a goal is scored it would be disallowed.

In all cases where the infraction being imposed is to the attacking Player for hindering the Goalkeeper's ability to move freely in their Goal Crease, the penalty to be assessed is for "Goalkeeper interference".

        If an attacking Player initiates "a relevant contact" with a Goalkeeper, incidental or otherwise, while the Goalkeeper is in their Goal Crease, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.
        If a Goalkeeper, in the "act of establishing their position" within their Goal Crease, initiates contact with an attacking Player who is in the Goal Crease, and this results in an impairment of the Goalkeeper's ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.
        If, after any contact by a Goalkeeper who is attempting to establish position in their Goal Crease, the attacking Player does not immediately vacate their current position in the Goal Crease (i.e., give ground to the Goalkeeper), and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed. In all such cases, whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking Player will receive the appropriate penalty for Goalkeeper "interference".
        If an attacking Player establishes a "significant position" within the Goal Crease, so as to obstruct the Goalkeeper's vision and impair their ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.
        For this purpose, a Player "establishes a significant position within the crease" when, in the Referee's judgment, their body, or a substantial portion thereof, is within the Goal Crease for more than an instantaneous period of time.

      title: CONTACT OUTSIDE THE GOAL CREASE
      rule: >  
        If an attacking Player initiates any "relevant contact" with a Goalkeeper, other than "incidental contact", while the Goalkeeper is outside their Goal Crease, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.
        A Goalkeeper is not "fair game" just because they are outside the Goal Crease. The appropriate penalty should be assessed in every case where an attacking Player makes "unnecessary contact" with the Goalkeeper.
        However, "incidental contact" will be permitted when the Goalkeeper is in the act of playing the puck outside their Goal Crease provided the attacking Player has made a "reasonable effort" to avoid such unnecessary contact.
        When a Goalkeeper has played the puck outside of their Goal Crease and is then prevented from returning to their Goal Crease area due to the deliberate actions of an attacking Player, such Player may be penalized for "Goalkeeper interference".
        Similarly, the Goalkeeper may be penalized, if by their actions outside of their Goal Crease they deliberately interfere with an attacking Player who is attempting to play the puck or an opponent.

        In the event a Goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck by an attacking Player after making a stop, the goal will be disallowed. If applicable, appropriate penalties will be assessed.
        If, however, in the opinion of the Referee, the attacking Player was pushed or otherwise fouled by a defending Player causing the Goalkeeper to be pushed into the net together with the puck, the goal can be permitted.
        In the event the puck is under a Player in or around the Goal Crease area (deliberately or otherwise), a goal cannot be scored by pushing this Player together with the puck into the goal.
